# 📊 Bank Loan Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application should be **approved or rejected** based on various customer details such as income, education, employment, and credit history.

The goal is to assist financial institutions in making data-driven loan approval decisions.

## 🔍 Project Overview

* Built a **Machine Learning model** to predict loan approval.
* Performed **data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
* Compared multiple ML algorithms and selected the best performing model.
* Achieved reliable predictions to help banks minimize **default risk**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python 🐍
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
* **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
* **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values
   * Encode categorical variables
   * Normalize numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Loan approval distribution
   * Impact of applicant income & loan amount
   * Correlation between features

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Train/Test Split
   * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   * Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve

4. **Prediction**

   * Input applicant details
   * Predict loan approval (`Yes`/`No`)

---

## 📊 Results

* Best Model: **Random Forest Classifier**
* Accuracy Achieved: **\~85%** (adjust as per your actual result)
* Insights:

  * Applicants with **higher credit history** are more likely to get loan approval.
  * Income-to-loan ratio is a strong predictor.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Deploy the model using **Streamlit / Flask**
* Add **real-time loan prediction web app**
* Use **Deep Learning** for better feature extraction
